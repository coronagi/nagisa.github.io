<h2><strong>Wabi Yoga & Sadou (Japnaese Tea Ceremony)</strong><br></h2>
Sadou is one of my cherished hobbies. I have developed concentration and manners, and 
come to appreciate the artistic aspects in the decorations of the room and the tools we use.
Leveraging my years of experience in tea ceremony, in Wabi-Yoga, I forcus on calming my mind, disconnecting from digital distractions, and creating the time to introspect.
This has become a crucial part of my routine.<br><br>

<h2><strong>Piano</strong><br></h2>
Playing the piano is the time for me to relax. Recently, I have been playing various four-hands songs. 
Below is the videos of us performing on a piano at SFU.<br><br>

<h2><strong>Cello</strong><br></h2>
I had joined an orchestra for 5 years, playing the cello. I love how rich its timbre is and how wide the range of expression cello can offer :) <br><br>
