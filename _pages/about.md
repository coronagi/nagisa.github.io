## Hi! My name is Nagisa!
I am an university student majoring in Mathematics and Computing science at Simon Fraser University. Here, I am excited to share about myself throuhout my journey.

I am originally from Japan, came to Canada for the first time in 2019 to pursue my university education. I am always eager to absorb new knowledge and try new things. Living alone in a new country has brought me many new experiences, not only in my studies but also in my life. I have been studying computing science, and in recent years, my interests have expanded to mathematics. In 2023, seeking further adventures, I went on an exchange study at a university in Melbourne, Australia.  Everyting I have learned and experienced has shaped me in some way, and understanding the cultures and values of different countries has broadened my perspective. 

Through my studies in computing science and mathematics, I have developped my logical thinking and problem-solving skills, and my hobbies and interests have allowed me to reach out into a variety of fields, from music, sports to arts. These activities contribute not only to my academic pursuits but also to my growth as a person. 

This portfolio is a record of my learning. Here, you wil find my technical projects as well as my personal hobbies. Thank you for visiting my site!
