<strong>Hackathon, Internship at Softbank, Tokyo</strong><br>
This project aimed at developing an app to reduce food waste, targeting working housewives.
Focused on the SDGs goals of responsible consumption and zero hunger, it seeks to minimize
food waste due to expired goods. The app automatically recognizes barcodes and expiry dates,
displaying product information, encouraging the purchase of items nearing expiration.
Key features include eliminating manual data entry and a user-friendly design that 
clearly shows expiry dates. Technical aspects like product information retrieval from barcodes,
expiry date recognition via OCR, and database management are thoroughly discussed.
Future prospects include expanding app functionality and applications in inventory management
for physical and online stores.

<strong>Demo video</strong><br> <sub>
<strong>0:00-0:04</strong>  Initially, when no data is registered, pressing the update button displays nothing.<br>
<strong>0:04-0:12</strong>  Suppose three products are scanned by a camera. <br>
<strong>0:13-0:28</strong>  Once the videos are input, the system starts processing in the background, searching for product names from barcodes and extracting expiration dates. 
It took a total of 117 seconds to extract data from the three videos. <br>
<strong>0:29-0:35</strong> The extracted data is sent to the front end through a database, and pressing the update button displays the data. <br>
<strong>0:35-0:40</strong> Items that are already used can be deleted by clicking the delete button.<br></sub><br>
