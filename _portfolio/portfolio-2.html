<strong>Hackathon, Internship at Softbank, Tokyo</strong><br>
This project aimed at developing an app to reduce food waste, targeting working housewives.
Focused on the SDGs goals of responsible consumption and zero hunger, it seeks to minimize
food waste due to expired goods. The app automatically recognizes barcodes and expiry dates,
displaying product information, encouraging the purchase of items nearing expiration.
Key features include eliminating manual data entry and a user-friendly design that 
clearly shows expiry dates. Technical aspects like product information retrieval from barcodes,
expiry date recognition via OCR, and database management are thoroughly discussed.
Future prospects include expanding app functionality and applications in inventory management
for physical and online stores.
