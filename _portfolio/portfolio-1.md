**Software Engineering at SFU**

**PlanIt** is a **social media travel application** designed for planning travelling more easily. A
user can create an account and sign in to see posts from their friends, as well as see public
posts. A post can be either a planning type of post, a review of a location, or a general
post. In addition, multiple people can work together to plan a single trip. The features of
our application include being able to see the weather on a map for a specific city, and
budget a trip using our travel cost and flight searcher. These cost calculators are designed
to be interlaced with the planning process for budgeting. After these are calculated, they
can be stored into a table, which can be transferred into a post. Users will be notified
when their friends post or when their friends interact with their post. In addition, they
have the ability to search through previous posts or use the existing database of travel
information for convenience.

Competitive Analysis:    
This can already be solved with Facebook and messaging group-chats for example, but
only for basic planning and you would have to put everything together yourself. Using
our application, you can streamline the planning process by making it easy to collaborate
with others, and stay organized. Similar to Google reviews and Yelp, we will also be
creating a review system for locations via review posts.

Software Used:  
The Heroku Toolbelt, Git, Java, PostgreSQL database

post history. This can also be used to view other specific accounts.
Every user will have a profile, which contains information about their saved details, and
posts they have created. If the user is the owner, they will be able to edit. If not, it will only display these details and hide the private posts.
