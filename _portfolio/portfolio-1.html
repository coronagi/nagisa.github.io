<br><strong>SFU Operations Research in collaboration with Vancouver Coastal Health</strong><br>
This project was completed in SFU’s Operations Research course (MATH 402W) in collaboration with Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH).
Working with two other team members, we evaluated two diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) treatment strategies 
-Total Contact Casting (TCC) and conventional regular dressings
with a focus on Vancouver and the Canadian healthcare context.
Because the project was conducted with VCH, we prioritized Canadian (and where possible, British Columbia–specific) data 
for costs, transportation assumptions, and emissions-related parameters.
This project was selected as a finalist for presentation at the 2025 Canadian Operational Research Society Conference.
<br>

<br><strong>My Contribution</strong><br>
I was responsible for constructing the Markov model, carrying out the cost assessment based on the model outputs,
and collecting the supporting data needed to parameterize the analysis. 
This included gathering Vancouver-focused inputs (e.g., local transportation cost assumptions and gas price inputs) 
and ensuring the model and cost structure aligned with the report’s scope and available VCH-relevant information.
<br>

<br><strong>Markov Model Construction</strong><br>
To compare long-term outcomes between TCC and regular dressings, 
I implemented a cohort Markov model that simulates DFU progression over 5 years. 
The model tracks 5,000 patients across six health states: DFU (unhealed), Healed, Recurrence, Amputation, Healed Amputation, and Mortality, 
where Mortality is treated as an absorbing state. 
Each cycle represents four months, and the simulation runs for 15 cycles. 
Transition probabilities for the regular dressing strategy were adopted from the literature, while the TCC strategy was adjusted using reported clinical benchmark healing performance 
(TCC: 90% healing in 42 days vs. regular wound care: 50% in 365 days). 
The transition matrix approach was implemented in Python using NumPy, allowing us to generate state distributions over time and compare the two treatment pathways.

<br>
Using Health Quality BC benchmarks (TCC: 90% healing in 42 days vs. regular care: 50% in 365 days), 
we adjusted the transition probabilities for DFU → Healed, DFU → Amputation, and Recurrence → Healed to reflect TCC’s improved healing performance, 
while keeping the rest of the transition structure consistent with the regular dressing model.
<br>


<br><strong>Cost Assessment Based on Model Outputs</strong><br>
Using the simulated state distributions from the Markov model, 
I led the economic evaluation by defining a cost vector for each health state and calculating costs per cycle by multiplying the cost vector by the state distribution. 
For regular dressings, DFU and Recurrence were modeled with ongoing per-cycle costs driven by visit frequency, materials, labor, and a 30% overhead assumption. 
For TCC, DFU and Recurrence carried higher per-cycle costs reflecting specialized casting kits and clinical labor, 
including an inflation-adjusted conversion of reported TCC kit value to 2025 CAD using health CPI assumptions in the report. 
High-cost events were represented explicitly, with Amputation and Mortality assigned large one-time costs in the model framework. 
This structure allowed us to compare both per-cycle costs and cumulative costs over the 5-year horizon 
and explain why TCC can be more expensive upfront but lower in long-run spending due to fewer transitions into severe, high-cost states.

<br><strong>Key Findings</strong><br>
The results showed that TCC produced better long-term outcomes than regular dressings in the simulation. 
By Cycle 15, the model projected 3,958 patients in the Healed state under TCC compared with 2,054 under regular dressings. 
Despite higher initial treatment costs, the analysis concluded that TCC reduced cumulative costs by ~50% over 5 years, primarily due to fewer amputations and mortality cases. 
In the environmental component of the report (transportation-related only), the reduced visit frequency for TCC (assumed 6 vs. 120 visits per patient) translated into 94.8% lower travel-related CO₂ per patient (3.46 kg vs. 67.02 kg), 
reinforcing that the operational design of care pathways can influence both cost and sustainability outcomes.
